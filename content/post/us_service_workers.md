# 1. Introduction

Here, I organize the articles I have read to develop a future research idea. 
In Section 2, the articles and related stats showing the current status of
American low wage workers especially in service jobs, in terms of
the size in labor market, working environment, and the trend over recent years.
Next, from Section 3 to 5, the articles about the socioeconomic problems 
these workers are faced with are organized based on topic.

# 2. Statistics on low wage workers in service jobs

- [The future of work - Trends and challenges for low-wage workers](https://www.epi.org/publication/bp341-future-of-work/)

- [Most Workers in Low-Wage Labor Market Work Substantial Hours, in Volatile Jobs](https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/most-workers-in-low-wage-labor-market-work-substantial-hours-in)

# 3. Underrepresentation of these workers in politics

# 4. Geographical mobility of these workers

# 5. Job mobility of these workers

My survey on this topic is begun from a CBS article, "[For millions, low-wage  
work really is a dead end](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/low-wage-work-really-is-a-dead-end-for-millions/)". This article introduces a new research paper from the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, titled "[Can Low-Wage Workers Get Better Jobs?](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr846.pdf), 
which traces the job transition of low-wage workers over a six years from 2011 
to 2017. In this paper, the result shows only little more than 5% of 
low-wage workers succeeded to get higher-paying job within 12 months, 
while about 11% left the workforce, 7% became unemployed, 
and 6% switched to a different low-wage job.
